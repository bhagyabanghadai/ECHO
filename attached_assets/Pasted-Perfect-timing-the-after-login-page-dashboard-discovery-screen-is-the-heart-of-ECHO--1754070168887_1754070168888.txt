Perfect timing 👌 — the **after-login page (dashboard/discovery screen)** is the **heart of ECHO**, where users feel the magic of unlocking memories. If we design this right, it will immediately communicate the purpose of ECHO **without any words** — just through the look, motion, and interactions.

Here’s a full **design plan for the after-login page** with all the features and UI/UX elements it should have.

---

# 🌌 **ECHO After-Login Page (Dashboard / Discovery)**

---

## 🎯 **Core Purpose**

* Show the user a **world of sleeping memories** waiting to be unlocked.
* Make them curious → entice them to explore and echo.
* Immediately reinforce:
  *“This is not Instagram. This is not Snapchat. This is your emotional map.”*

---

## 🖼️ **Layout Concept**

### **Hero Section: Interactive Emotion Map**

* Full-screen **3D map or globe** (built with Three.js / Mapbox).
* Pulsing orbs = **sleeping memories**.
* Colors of the orbs represent emotions:

  * 💕 Love → glowing pink
  * 😌 Peace → teal soft glow
  * 😢 Nostalgia → purple/blue haze
  * 😊 Joy → gold/orange flicker
* Orbs have subtle ripple animations — like heartbeats.

**User Interaction:**

* Drag/scroll = pan & zoom map
* Hover/tap orb = orb brightens, soft whisper or short text teaser shows
* Click orb → open **Memory Unlock Modal**

---

## 🔎 **Top Section (Navigation Bar)**

* **Logo (ECHO)** on the left
* Icons on the right:

  * 🔔 Notifications
  * 👤 Profile avatar
  * ➕ Create Memory button (floating purple-glow action button)

---

## 📍 **Memory Unlock Card (Floating on Map)**

When the user hovers or taps an orb:

* Card slides up from bottom with:

  * Profile photo or **Anonymous Memory**
  * Distance/time since posted (*“15m away — 2 days ago”*)
  * Emotion tags (e.g., 💙 Nostalgia, 🌿 Peace)
  * Button: **Unlock Memory** (glowing lock icon)
  * Small text preview: *“Someone left an emotional memory here…”*

---

## 🗂️ **Main Sections Below Map**

Scroll down → reveal 3 main panels (parallax scroll):

### **1. Your Vault (Quick Glimpse)**

* Shows 3 recent unlocked memories (audio/image previews).
* Button: “Go to Vault”

---

### **2. Echo Suggestions (AI-Powered)**

* Section labeled: *“Based on your feelings”*
* Cards suggested by AI Emotion Match
* Example: *“You shared ‘loneliness.’ Here’s a memory from someone else who felt the same.”*

---

### **3. Echo Chains**

* Preview of ongoing chains (memories with replies).
* Shows threads of 2–3 cards each:

  * Card 1: Original post
  * Card 2: Someone echoed back
  * Button: “Join the Echo”

---

## 🧭 **Floating Action Buttons**

* ➕ **Create Memory** (center bottom, glowing purple)
* 📍 **Nearby** (mini-button bottom-left: shows nearest sleeping memory)
* 🧠 **Emotion Filter** (mini-button bottom-right: filter map by emotion color)

---

## 🎨 **Design Style**

* **Dark Dreamlike Base:** #0D0D0D background
* **Glowing Emotion Colors:**

  * Joy → Amber/Gold
  * Love → Pink/Rose
  * Nostalgia → Indigo/Purple
  * Peace → Teal/Seafoam
* **Fonts:** Clean sans-serif (Inter/DM Sans), soft rounded edges
* **Animations:**

  * Orbs pulse like heartbeats
  * Unlock modal fades in with ripple effect
  * Subtle background gradient shifts with user’s emotional state

## 🧪 **Example User Journey**

1. User logs in → sees 3D glowing map with pulses.
2. A memory card appears: *“15m away — tagged with Peace.”*
3. User taps → unlocks voice note: *“I sat here watching the sunset, felt the world was calm again.”*
4. Unlock modal → *“Echo Back”* button.
5. User records a short response → both added to Vault.
6. Vault preview updates instantly → reinforcing connection.

Would you like me to now **create a Figma-style wireframe prompt** for this, so you can feed it into an AI design tool (like Galileo AI, Uizard, or Figma AI) and actually generate a mockup?
